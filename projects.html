<h2>Dark Matter Simulator</h2>
<p>
When a new astronomy professor arrived at Foothill College, he 
approached us at the computer science club. He spoke ominously of an impending 
doomsday known as the "End of Adobe Flash", and thus the end of his favorite astronomy
simulations, and was in search of those who could help him rebuild.
He also had an idea for a new simulation, which led to the creation of
the Dark Matter Simulator.

<p>
The Dark Matter Simulator is an education web browser simulation for college astronomy classes used to learn
about dark matter, and how it affects the velocity of stars in a galaxy! The
simulation features real data from published observations to show how stars in
galaxies are moving more quickly than expected, and how dark matter can be used
to explain why.

<h2>Balloon Jump Game</h2>
<p>
I wanted to make a simple and somewhat novel game that would be 
described as "fun" by people other than myself.
</p>

<img src="img/balloon1.gif" class="main-img"/>

<p>
I began to look at arcade and mobile games for inspiration, and
they are generally simpler, but can still be described as fun. The 
mechanics were inspired by Doodle Jump, and the balloon theme was 
inspired by an xkcd comic: https://xkcd.com/1106/
</p>

<p>
In order to determine if the game was actually fun for other people,
I needed lots of other people to play it. 
So I choose to make it as a mobile-friendly browser game, and sent 
the link to everybody I knew, or handed my phone directly to my friends 
and asked them try it.
</p>

<p>
I would try my hardest not to give them any instruction or hints, so
that I could learn what their experience would be like if I were not 
there at all. This was incredibly valuable, and helped give me direction 
about what to work on next to improve the game.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, it reached a point where multiple people described it as
"pretty fun!" and my goal was reached.
