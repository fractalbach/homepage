<blockquote>
I think it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing.... Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.
<p>&mdash; Alan Perlis</p>

<blockquote>
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.
<p>&mdash; Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p>

Diligence is the mother of good luck

What maintains one vice, would bring up two children
